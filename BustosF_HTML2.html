		<p>I currently have a plan that I am currently sticking to, in order to ensure that I complete all my assignments for CTI 110, on time. 
		When the assignments open for the week I do a quick skim. Preparing myself for Tuesday’s lesson. 
		My goal for the end of that day’s class, is to finish Khan Academy lesson. 
		If I do not manage to finish the lesson, I then would finish at home before Wednesday's class. 
		If I have free time before Wednesday's class, then I would begin to work on the week’s assignment. 
		My goal for Wednesday's class is to begin and complete the week’s assignment before the end of the class. 
		I promise to complete all assignments by their due dates. </p>
